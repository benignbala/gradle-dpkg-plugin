== Tasks

The *dpkg* plugin provides one default task called _dpkg_ that can be
configured to accept the package name, the source directory to look
for and the command lines flags to the dpkg tool. Subsequently, the
task will create the control file as well by accepting arguments from
the gradle build file.

dpkg {
    pkgName 'my_package'
    srcDir file('/debian/pkgs/my_package')
}
